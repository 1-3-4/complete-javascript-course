/*
Everything is an object; except primitives:
- Numbers
- Strings
- Booleans
- Undefined
- Null

CONSTRUCTOR/PROTOYPE is called CLASS in C#.
Objects made from a constructor are called INSTANCES.

Inheritance makes it possible to create constructor that extends another constructor, thereby inheriting all the properties and methods of the parent constructor.
